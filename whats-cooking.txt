What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2025, #05; Mon, 11)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

 - remote.c: convert if-else ladder to switch
 - remote.c: remove BUG in show_push_unqualified_ref_name_error()
 - t5516: remove surrounding empty lines in test bodies

 "git push" had a code path that led to BUG() but it should have
 been a die(), as it is a response to a usual but invalid end-user
 action to attempt pushing an object that does not exist.

 - diff: --no-index should ignore the worktree

 "git diff --no-index" run inside a subdirectory under control of a
 Git repository operated at the top of the working tree and stripped
 the prefix from the output, and oddballs like "-" (stdin) did not
 work correctly because of it.  Correct the set-up by undoing what
 the set-up sequence did to cwd and prefix.
