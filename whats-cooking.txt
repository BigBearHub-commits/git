What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2025, #10; Fri, 22)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

Git 2.51 has been tagged.  Let's see if there is any unexpected
fallout for the rest of this week, and then start merging down what
has been cooking in 'next' (and rewind 'next' while doing so).

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

* ac/deglobal-fmt-merge-log-config (2025-08-10) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2025-08-13 at c6c74fb8f0)
 + builtin/fmt-merge-msg: stop depending on 'the_repository'

 Code clean-up.

* dl/push-missing-object-error (2025-08-08) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2025-08-11 at ad69d77794)
 + remote.c: convert if-else ladder to switch
 + remote.c: remove BUG in show_push_unqualified_ref_name_error()
 + t5516: remove surrounding empty lines in test bodies

 "git push" had a code path that led to BUG() but it should have
 been a die(), as it is a response to a usual but invalid end-user
 action to attempt pushing an object that does not exist.

* en/ort-rename-fixes (2025-08-06) 7 commits

* gh/git-jump-pathname-with-sp (2025-08-11) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2025-08-13 at a99311e231)
 + git-jump: make `diff` work with filenames containing spaces

 "git jump" (in contrib/) fails to parse the diff header correctly
 when a file has a space in its name, which has been corrected.
 source: <pull.1950.v2.git.1754913323810.gitgitgadget@gmail.com>


* jc/diff-no-index-in-subdir (2025-08-09) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2025-08-13 at 956899dc16)
 + diff: --no-index should ignore the worktree

 "git diff --no-index" run inside a subdirectory under control of a
 Git repository operated at the top of the working tree and stripped
 the prefix from the output, and oddballs like "-" (stdin) did not
 work correctly because of it.  Correct the set-up by undoing what
 the set-up sequence did to cwd and prefix.

* jc/strbuf-split (2025-07-31) 13 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2025-08-11 at ddf662f7e9)

 + clean: do not pass the whole structure when it is not necessary
 + clean: do not use strbuf_split*() [part 1]
 + clean: do not pass strbuf by value
 + wt-status: avoid strbuf_split*()
 + Merge branch 'jc/string-list-split' into jc/strbuf-split
 (this branch uses jc/string-list-split.)

 Arrays of strbuf is often a wrong data structure to use, and
 strbuf_split*() family of functions that create them often have
 better alternatives.

 Update several code paths and replace strbuf_split*().

* jc/string-list-split (2025-08-01) 7 commits

 + string-list: report programming error with BUG
 (this branch is used by jc/strbuf-split.)

 string_list_split*() family of functions have been extended to
 simplify common use cases.

 During interactive rebase, using 'drop' on a merge commit lead to

  (merged to 'next' on 2025-08-12 at 0f929dcec7)
 + bloom: enable bloom filter with wildcard pathspec in revision traversal

 Revision traversal limited with pathspec, like "git log dir/*",
 used to ignore changed-paths Bloom filter when the pathspec
 contained wildcards; now they take advantage of the filter when
 they can.

  (merged to 'next' on 2025-08-13 at 662b1ed5c5)
 + diff: ensure consistent diff behavior with ignore options

 Various options to "git diff" that makes comparison ignore certain
 aspects of the differences (like "space changes are ignored",
 "differences in lines that match these regular expressions are
 ignored") did not work well with "--name-only" and friends.

 "git refs migrate" to migrate the reflog entries from a refs

 "git remote rename origin upstream" failed to move origin/HEAD to
 upstream/HEAD when origin/HEAD is unborn and performed other
 renames extremely inefficiently, which has been corrected.
