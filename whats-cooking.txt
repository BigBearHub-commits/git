What's cooking in git.git (Sep 2025, #06; Mon, 15)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking in my tree.  Commits
prefixed with '+' are in 'next' (being in 'next' is a sign that a
topic is stable enough to be used and are candidate to be in a
future release).  Commits prefixed with '-' are only in 'seen', and
aren't considered "accepted" at all and may be annotated with an URL
to a message that raises issues but they are no means exhaustive.  A
topic without enough support may be discarded after a long period of
no activity (of course they can be resubmit when new interests
arise).

There are a few topics that have been expecting a reroll for close
to a month.  I've moved them to the [Stalled] section below.  Let's
tighten rules around these topics a bit so that we can keep the tree
somewhat cleaner.

Copies of the source code to Git live in many repositories, and the
following is a list of the ones I push into or their mirrors.  Some
repositories have only a subset of branches.

With maint, master, next, seen, todo:

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
	git://repo.or.cz/alt-git.git/
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/
	https://github.com/git/git/
	https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/

With all the integration branches and topics broken out:

	https://github.com/gitster/git/

Even though the preformatted documentation in HTML and man format
are not sources, they are published in these repositories for
convenience (replace "htmldocs" with "manpages" for the manual
pages):

	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git-htmldocs.git/
	https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs.git/

Release tarballs are available at:

* jt/de-global-bulk-checkin (2025-08-22) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2025-09-08 at f544afcab3)
 + bulk-checkin: use repository variable from transaction
 + bulk-checkin: require transaction for index_blob_bulk_checkin()
 + bulk-checkin: remove global transaction state
 + bulk-checkin: introduce object database transaction structure
 (this branch is used by jt/odb-transaction.)

 The bulk-checkin code used to depend on a file-scope static
 singleton variable, which has been updated to pass an instance
 throughout the callchain.

 + repo: add the flag -z as an alias for --format=nul
 + Merge branch 'lo/repo-info' into lo/repo-info-step-2

 "repo info" learns a short-hand option "-z" that is the same as
 "--format=nul", and learns to report the objects format used in the
 repository.

 + t5530: modernize tests

 A broken or malicious "git fetch" can say that it has the same
 object for many many times, and the upload-pack serving it can
 exhaust memory storing them redundantly, which has been corrected.

[Stalled]

These topics have been expecting updates for quite some time.  I'll
eject any of them when they start to conflict with other topics in
'seen' and may drop them from my tree when they are dormant for too
long (let's say 8 weeks is way too long, for now).  After that, they
can be proposed again by rerolling them in a shape that would work
well with other topics in 'seen' (and of course 'next' and
"master').

 communicated from the server side.

 - builtin/config: special-case retrieving colors without a key
 - builtin/config: do not die in `get_color()`
 - t1300: small style fixups

 The use of "git config get" command to learn how ANSI color
 sequence is for a particular type, e.g., "git config get
 --type=color --default=reset no.such.thing", isn't very ergonomic.

 The "string-list" API function to find where a given string would
 be inserted got updated so that it can use unrealistically huge
 array index that would only fit in size_t but not int or ssize_t
 to achieve unstated goal.
